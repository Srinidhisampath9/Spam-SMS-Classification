# Spam-SMS-Classification
## Project Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The objective is to develop an effective model that can automatically identify and filter out spam messages.
## Project Files
### Data
spam.csv: This file contains the dataset with SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. It includes columns like 'label' and 'message'.
### Notebooks
Spam SMS Classification.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the SMS spam classification. It includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.
### Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk

### Analysis Workflow
The analysis is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Loading: Importing the SMS messages dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the text data, tokenization, and feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF.
3. Model Training: Training different machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) on the preprocessed data.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings, selecting the best model, and discussing potential improvements.
## Results
The results of the analysis include the performance metrics of different models, with a focus on the most accurate and efficient model for classifying SMS messages. Visualizations and summary statistics are used to illustrate the model performance.
